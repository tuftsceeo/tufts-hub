# Contributing

Many thanks for wanting to improve our project.

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from *anyone* irrespective of
their background. If you're thinking, "but they don't mean me", *then we
especially mean YOU*. Good quality code and engagement with respect, humour
and intelligence wins every time.

* If you're from a background which isn't well-represented in most tech
  groups, get involved - *we want to help you make a difference*.
* If you're from a background which *is* well-represented in most tech
  groups, get involved - *we want your help making a difference*.
* If you're worried about not being technical enough, get involved - *your
  fresh perspective will be invaluable*.
* If you think you're an imposter, get involved.
* If your day job isn't code, get involved.
* This isn't a group of experts, just people collaborating with mutual
  respect and a focus on humanity and dignity. If this resonates, get
  involved!

We expect contributors to follow the spirit of our statement in the
`CARE_OF_COMMUNITY.md` file.

Feedback may be given for contributions and, where necessary, changes will
be politely requested and discussed with the originating author. Respectful
yet robust argument is most welcome.
